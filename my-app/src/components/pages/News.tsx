      Dogs can cry when owners come home, study suggests
      </h2>
      <p>Dogs can cry tears of joy when they are reunited with their owners, a small study has found. <br />

Canines may be genuinely thrilled when they see their human companions after a long period of absence, Japanese researchers have said.<br />
The tears are believed to deepen the bond between dogs and their owners.<br />
The study, based on the behaviour of 22 dogs, looked at the reactions of dogs who were reunited with their owners and with other people they knew.<br />
To test their theory, academics at Azabu University and Jichi Medical University placed strips of paper under the eyes of the dogs <br /> during normal interaction with their owners and a minute before they were reunited with them after five-to-seven hours of separation.</p>
